    "questions": {
      "whatIsVirtualStaging": {
        "question": "What is virtual staging?",
        "answer": "Virtual staging is the process of digitally furnishing a property photo to showcase its potential, helping buyers envision how a space can look and feel when fully styled. Unlike traditional staging, it's faster, more cost-effective, and allows for multiple design options tailored to different buyer preferences. With high-quality visuals, virtual staging highlights the property's best features, making it easier for buyers to connect emotionally and imagine themselves living there."
      },
      "howLong": {
        "question": "How long does it take?",
        "answer": "On average, virtual staging takes around 8 seconds per photo to process, though the exact time can be a little shorter or longer depending on the complexity of the space and the design style chosen. The result is a quick, seamless transformation that makes your property photos stand out."
      },
      "customTheme": {
        "question": "How do I select a custom theme?",
        "answer": "If you don't see the theme you want, you can select \"Custom\" and then add a specific prompt for the theme you want. We'll use your prompt to generate the theme you want."
      },
      "idealRoom": {
        "question": "What makes an ideal room for staging?",
        "answer": "An ideal room for staging should have good lighting, clear walls, and minimal clutter. Empty or sparsely furnished rooms work best, as they provide a clean canvas for the AI to add furniture and decor that matches your chosen style."
      },
      "privacy": {
        "question": "Is my data private and secure?",
        "answer": "Yes, we take your privacy seriously. Your uploaded images are processed securely and are not stored permanently on our servers. We use industry-standard encryption and do not share your data with third parties."
